# Momo VS Code Extension Development Plan

## Step 1: Design AI prompts and interaction model

- Define the structure and format of prompts for different tasks (code generation, editing, refactoring)
  - Create a `PromptTemplate` class to standardize prompt structures
  - Implement task-specific prompt templates (e.g., `CodeGenerationPrompt`, `CodeEditingPrompt`, `CodeRefactoringPrompt`)

- Create a system for dynamically generating prompts based on user input and file context
  - Develop a `PromptGenerator` class that combines user input, file context, and task-specific templates
  - Implement context-aware prompt generation using the `@` symbol system for referencing files, folders, and code snippets

- Design the interaction flow between the user, the extension, and the AI
  - Create a `UserInteractionManager` class to handle user inputs and manage the conversation flow
  - Implement a state machine to track the current stage of the interaction (e.g., initial prompt, follow-up questions, applying changes)

- Develop a strategy for handling AI responses and integrating them into the workflow
  - Create an `AIResponseHandler` class to parse and process AI-generated responses
  - Implement methods for extracting code suggestions, explanations, and follow-up questions from AI responses
  - Design a system for presenting AI suggestions to the user and allowing them to accept, reject, or modify the changes

## Step 2: Implement codebase indexing and file management

- Create a system for scanning and indexing the user's codebase
- Implement file tracking to detect changes and updates in real-time
- Develop a mechanism for efficient storage and retrieval of indexed code
- Design a strategy for handling large codebases and optimizing performance
- Implement .momoignore functionality for excluding files from indexing

## Step 3: Set up project structure and implement core functionality

- Initialize a new VS Code extension project using Yeoman generator
- Set up TypeScript and Webpack configuration
- Create the basic extension structure (extension.ts, package.json, etc.)
- Implement a simple "Hello World" command to test the extension
- Create a WebviewProvider for the sidebar
- Design and implement the chat interface UI
- Set up basic communication between the extension and webview
- Add file selection functionality for context management
- Set up secure API key management using VS Code settings
- Implement the aiService.ts to handle communication with Gemini AI
- Create basic prompt generation and response handling
- Test AI integration with simple code generation tasks

## Step 4: Implement file context management

- Develop the composer.ts to handle multi-file context
- Implement functions to add, remove, and update file contexts
- Create a UI component in the sidebar to display and manage file contexts
- Test file context management with various file types and sizes

## Step 5: Create diff view and code suggestion handling

- Implement diffViewProvider.ts for showing code changes
- Design the UI for displaying diffs between original and AI-suggested code
- Add functionality to apply or reject individual AI suggestions
- Implement a mechanism to apply changes to the actual files in the workspace

## Step 6: Develop multi-file editing capabilities

- Extend composer.ts to handle operations across multiple files
- Implement logic to generate and apply changes to multiple files simultaneously
- Create a UI component to display progress for multi-file operations
- Test multi-file editing with various scenarios (e.g., refactoring, code generation)

## Step 7: Implement progress tracking and status updates

- Design and implement a progress tracking system for AI operations
- Create UI components to display real-time status updates for individual files
- Implement overall progress indicators for multi-file operations
- Add user notifications for completed tasks, errors, and important events

## Step 8: Refine UI, add advanced features, and prepare for release

- Implement comprehensive error handling throughout the extension
- Add support for custom user instructions (.momorules)
- Optimize performance for large codebases
- Conduct thorough testing and debugging
- Prepare documentation and comply with VS Code Marketplace guidelines
- Implement any final UI/UX improvements based on testing feedback
